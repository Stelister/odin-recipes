        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition. We frequently double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker. Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day! Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the leftovers.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices day-old white bread, crumbled</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
            <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
            <li>2/3 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until light brown, about 10 minutes. Transfer onion to a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with onion in the mixing bowl. Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream.</li>
            <li>Bring gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Just before serving, whisk in sour cream. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve gravy with meatballs.</li>
        </ol>
