        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks, beaten</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can cream of coconut</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white rum</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine evaporated milk and egg yolks in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Cook over the simmering water, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, and reaches a temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer mixture to a blender. Add cream of coconut, sweetened condensed milk, rum, water, vanilla, cinnamon, and cloves; blend until combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour into sterilized glass bottles and store in the refrigerator; serve cold or over ice, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
